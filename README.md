# Local_Government_Employee_Data_Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves a basic exploratory data analysis in R, of a dataset containing staff information from various departments in local government. The dataset consists of 366 employees and includes information on department, tenure, sick days, and response rates to enquiries.

The analysis is intended for an audience with no prior background in statistics or data analytics. It focuses on using clear visualizations and straightforward statistical summaries to present the key insights.

### Analysis Objectives
The analysis focuses on providing a clear understanding of data distributions, inter-variable relationships, and group-based performance insights, using appropriate statistical summaries and visual tools.

**Components**

* **Variable Distributions**

  Visualizations were created for each variable using formats appropriate to their type:

  * Bar chart for Department
  * Histograms or boxplots for continuous variables (Time, sick_days, response_target, ftime)

  Each plot is clearly labeled and designed for clarity and accessibility.

* **Descriptive Statistics**

  Summary tables include:

  * Means, medians, standard deviations, and quartiles for continuous variables
  * Frequencies and percentages for categorical data

  Descriptions are included to contextualize the statistics in non-technical language.

* **Group Comparisons**

  response_target performance was compared across:

  * Different departments
  * Groupings of employment duration

  Results are summarized in tabular format with accompanying interpretation.

* **Trend Analysis by Time**

  A visual summary of response_target by grouped Time values was created.

  Groups are presented in ascending order to reflect tenure progression.

  The graph choice (e.g., line plot, boxplot) and its relevance are clearly explained.

* **Relationship Exploration: Sick Days & Responsiveness**

  The relationship between sick_days and response_target is visualized using a scatter or smoothed trend plot.

  The visual aids interpretation of how staff wellness may relate to performance.
